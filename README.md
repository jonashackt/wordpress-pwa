Example project showing how to serve a Wordpress site as a Progressive Web App (PWA)


# Is it possible to run Wordpress as a PWA?

There are Wordpress plugins like https://wordpress.org/plugins/super-progressive-web-apps that promise to enable PWA features for Wordpress based sites without effort. You can demo it on https://superpwa.com/ - open it in your mobile Browser and add it to your homescreen. Should work out of the box, right?!

But simply activating the plugin on a wordpress.com site won't work without throwing in some money!
